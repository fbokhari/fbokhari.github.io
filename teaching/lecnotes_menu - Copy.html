<h3 align="left">Teaching Summary </h3>

<p>I have taught undergraduate, masterâ€™s, and Ph.D. students at UEA and other institutions. The bulk of my teaching has been to economics majors to whom I have taught microeconomics, econometrics, statistics, math methods, industrial organization, and health economics at both the graduate and undergraduate levels.  But I also have significant experience at teaching to non-economists.  I have taught Health Economics and Policy to medical and public health students and Competition Economics and/IO to professionals from regulatory agencies and consulting firms.  Currently, I both teach in and serve as the program co-director for the Postgraduate Certificate in Competition and Regulatory Policy run via CCP at UEA. </p>
