<h2>General Background</h2>

  I am a lecture in the Department of Primary Care and Public Health Sciences and an and affiliate faculty at the Petris Center on Health Care Markets & Consumer Welfare at the University of California, Berkeley. Prior to joining Kings, I was an assistant professor of economics at Florida State University.   I received my high school certificate (HSC) from Aitchison College Lahore, Pakistan in 1988 and then came to the U.S. for undergraduate work in the fall of '89. I received a B.A. degree from Bard College in 1993 and got my Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon in 2001 and did my postdoctoral work at University of California, Berkeley.

To date, my research has been in the areas of managed care, health care technologies and more recently in mental health issues, specifically, the economic and policy analysis of Attention Deficit/Hyper Activity Disorder (ADHD) and market for psychostimulant drugs. My other research interests are in the evolution of industrial structures, and the innovation, adoption and diffusion of technologies.
