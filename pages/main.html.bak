<h2 style="font-weight: bold;">General Background</h2>


I am an Associate Professor in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.uea.ac.uk/about/school-of-economics">School
of Economics</a> and the <a href="https://competitionpolicy.ac.uk/">Centre for Competition Policy (CCP)</a> at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_East_Anglia">University of East Anglia (UEA)</a>.
I am an empirical economist with
a strong policy focus.&nbsp; My research falls into two overlapping
areas: (i) industrial organization and competition economics (mostly
applied to the health sector. i.e., hospitals, pharmaceuticals, etc.
but not exclusively), and (ii) health outcomes and health
policies.&nbsp; The latter also spill into issues of education, gender,
and racial equity.&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal">I am a co-editor at <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14657295" target="_blank">Economic
Inquiry</a> where I mostly handle applied papers. I am also the new Data&nbsp;Editor for the journal. Here is a&nbsp;<a href="https://weai.org/view/ei-editors-corner?fbclid=IwAR2dL6Ogr3Mfo1MRpepEsbSJB4OdAcKySl_8ofjCKunILj0NAVCoy_atNsg">statement
by the Editor</a> of the journal&nbsp;(<a href="https://s2.smu.edu/tsalmon/" target="_blank">Tim Salmon</a>)
about our policies. If you are an academic, I hope his statement gives you a reason to
send your next paper to EI. <br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Some of my recent work in pharmaceuticals focuses on firm strategies and how they
impact consumer welfare, firm profits, and growth. I have worked on the
valuation/welfare effects of introducing generics and <a href="../papers/bf2008-1v5.pdf">second-generation
(`me-too') drugs</a> in a product market, the <a href="../papers/bbm2014-1-v04e.pdf">impact of
additional presentations on the growth</a> of a business unit, and now more recently on e<a href="../papers/by2019-1-v03b.pdf">ntry
deterring effects of presentation proliferation and of product hopping</a>.&nbsp; I have also
worked on <a href="../papers/bmp2014-1-v04f.pdf">pay-for-delay deals in the European and American</a> legal contexts and the <a href="../papers/b2012-2v02.pdf">cost</a> of such (anticompetitive) deals. One of the main contributions of this work is the policy simulations that
show which legislative changes are likely to make anti-competitive deals not
possible and which might make the situation worse.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">

Concurrently, I am also working on policies to address the rise of <a href="../papers/bmy2017-1-v02b.pdf">antibacterial resistance</a>
via
managing the demand for broad- vs narrow-spectrum antibiotics.&nbsp; I
also have current work on evaluating alcohol regulations such as a <a href="../papers/bdms2019-1-v02a.pdf">ban
on non-linear pricing</a> or establishing <a href="../papers/bcdm2021-1-v01h.pdf">price floors</a> to curb excessive alcohol consumption and its heterogenous impact. <br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><br>
I have taught undergraduate, master&#8217;s, and Ph.D. students at UEA and
other institutions. The bulk of my teaching has been to economics
majors to
whom I have taught microeconomics, econometrics, statistics, math
methods, industrial organization, and health economics at both the
graduate and undergraduate levels.&nbsp; But I also have
significant experience at teaching to non-economists.&nbsp; I have
taught Health Economics and Policy to medical and public
health students and Competition Economics and/IO to professionals from
regulatory agencies and consulting firms.&nbsp; Currently, I both teach
in and
serve as the program co-director for the <a target="_blank" href="https://competitionpolicy.ac.uk/online-ccp-certificate">Postgraduate
Certificate in Competition and Regulatory Policy</a> run via CCP at UEA. 

</p>
I got my Ph.D. in Public Policy and Management from the Heinz School at
Carnegie Mellon University, USA. Before joining UEA, I
was a Lecturer (Assistant prof) at King&#8217;s College London (Department of
Primary Care and Public Health Sciences) and before that an Assistant
Professor at
Florida State University (Department of Economics). I also did a
two-year post-doctoral stint at the University of California, Berkeley
(School of Public
Health).&nbsp; I got my undergraduate degree from Bard College, NY in
physics and economics with a concentration in mathematics. <br>

<br>

I am of Pakistani origin (a proud Lahori and an <a href="https://www.aitchison.edu.pk/" target="_blank">Aitchisonian</a>),
have two children and a wife, and four siblings. I try not to tell them too many dad jokes. <span><br>
