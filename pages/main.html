<h2 style="font-weight: bold;">General Background</h2>




I am a Professor of Economics at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lboro.ac.uk/schools/business-school/"> Loughborough Business School </a> and specialize in empirical economics with a strong policy focus. My research encompasses two interrelated domains: (1) Industrial organization and competition economics, primarily applied within the health sector (including hospitals, pharmaceuticals, etc.), though not limited to it, and (2) health economics, outcomes and policies, extending into broader social issues such as education, gender, and racial equity. I strive to integrate rigorous empirical analysis with real-world policy implications across these interconnected areas of study.


</p>
I also serve as the Co-editor for <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14657295" target="_blank">Economic  Inquiry</a> as well as the journal's Data Editor.  


<p class="MsoNormal">Some of my recent work in pharmaceuticals focuses on firm strategies and how they
impact consumer welfare, firm profits, and growth. I have worked on the
valuation/welfare effects of introducing generics and <a href="../papers/bf2008-1v5.pdf">second-generation
(`me-too') drugs</a> in a product market, the <a href="../papers/bbm2014-1-v04e.pdf">impact of
additional presentations on the growth</a> of a business unit, and now more recently on e<a href="../papers/by2019-1-v03b.pdf">ntry
deterring effects of presentation proliferation and of product hopping</a>.&nbsp; I have also
worked on <a href="../papers/bmp2014-1-v04f.pdf">pay-for-delay deals in the European and American</a> legal contexts and the <a href="../papers/b2012-2v02.pdf">cost</a> of such (anticompetitive) deals. One of the main contributions of this work is the policy simulations that
show which legislative changes are likely to make anti-competitive deals not
possible and which might make the situation worse.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">

Concurrently, I am also working on policies to address the rise of <a href="../papers/bmy2017-1-v02b.pdf">antibacterial resistance</a>
via
managing the demand for broad- vs narrow-spectrum antibiotics.&nbsp; I
also have current work on evaluating alcohol regulations such as a <a href="../papers/bdms2019-1-v02a.pdf">ban
on non-linear pricing</a> or establishing <a href="../papers/bcdm2021-1-v01h.pdf">price floors</a> to curb excessive alcohol consumption and its heterogenous impact. <br>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><br>
I have taught undergraduate, master&#8217;s, and Ph.D. students at various  institutions. The bulk of my teaching has been to economics
majors to
whom I have taught microeconomics, econometrics, statistics, math
methods, industrial organization, and health economics at both the
graduate and undergraduate levels.&nbsp; But I also have
significant experience at teaching to non-economists.&nbsp; I have
taught Health Economics and Policy to medical and public
health students and Competition Economics and/IO to professionals from
regulatory agencies and consulting firms.

</p>
I got my Ph.D. in Public Policy and Management from the Heinz School at
Carnegie Mellon University, USA. Before joining Loughbrough, I was an Associate Professor at UEA and 
a Lecturer (Assistant prof) at King&#8217;s College London (Department of
Primary Care and Public Health Sciences) and before that an Assistant
Professor at
Florida State University (Department of Economics). I also did a
two-year post-doctoral stint at the University of California, Berkeley
(School of Public
Health).&nbsp; I got my undergraduate degree from Bard College, NY in
physics and economics with a concentration in mathematics. <br>

<br>

I am of Pakistani origin (a proud Lahori and an <a href="https://www.aitchison.edu.pk/" target="_blank">Aitchisonian</a>),
have two children and a wife, and four siblings. I try not to tell them too many dad jokes. <span><br>
