<h2 style="font-weight: bold;">General Background</h2>

<p class="MsoNormal">I am an Associate Professor in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.uea.ac.uk/about/school-of-economics">School
of Economics</a> and
the <a href="https://competitionpolicy.ac.uk/">Centre for Competition
Policy (CCP)</a> at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_East_Anglia">University
of East Anglia (UEA)</a>.<span>&nbsp; I am an empirical economist with
a strong policy focus.&nbsp; My research falls into two overlapping
areas: (i) industrial organization and competition economics (mostly
applied to the health sector. i.e., hospitals, pharmaceuticals, etc.
but not exclusively), and (ii) health outcomes and health
policies.&nbsp; The latter also spills over into issues of education,
gender, and racial equity.&nbsp; </span> <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I am a co-editor at <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14657295" target="_blank">Economic
Inquiry</a> where I mostly handle applied papers. <span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">I
am also the new Data&nbsp;Editor for the journal. Here is a&nbsp;<a href="https://weai.org/view/ei-editors-corner?fbclid=IwAR2dL6Ogr3Mfo1MRpepEsbSJB4OdAcKySl_8ofjCKunILj0NAVCoy_atNsg">statement
by
the Editor</a> of the journal&nbsp;(<a href="https://s2.smu.edu/tsalmon/" target="_blank">Tim Salmon</a>)
about our policies.<span style=""> If you are an academic, </span>I
hope his statement gives you a reason to
send your next paper to EI. </span> <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Some of my
recent work in pharmaceuticals focuses on firm strategies and how they
impact
consumer welfare, firm profits, and growth. I have worked on the
valuation/welfare
effects of introducing generics and </span><a href="../papers/bf2008-1v5.pdf">second-generation (`me-too') drugs</a><span lang="EN-GB"> in a
product market, the <a href="../papers/bbm2014-1-v04e.pdf">impact of
additional presentations on the growth</a> of a business
unit, and now more recently on e<a href="../papers/by2019-1-v03b.pdf">ntry
deterring effects of presentation proliferation
and of product hopping</a>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have also
worked on <a href="../papers/bmp2014-1-v04f.pdf">pay-for-delay deals
in the European and American</a> legal contexts and the <a href="../papers/b2012-2v02.pdf">cost</a> of such (anticompetitive)
deals. One
of the main contributions of this work is the policy simulations that
show which
legislative changes are likely to make anti-competitive deals not
possible and
which might make the situation worse.<span style=""></span></span><span style="" lang="EN-GB"><o:p></o:p><br>
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="" lang="EN-GB">Concurrently,
I am also working on policies to address the rise of <a href="../papers/bmy2017-1-v02b.pdf">antibacterial resistance</a> via
managing the demand for broad- vs narrow-spectrum antibiotics as well
as on evaluating
regulations such as a <a href="../papers/bdms2019-1-v02a.pdf">ban on
non-linear pricing</a> or establishing <a href="../papers/bcdm2021-1-v01h.pdf">price floors</a> to curb
excessive alcohol consumption and its heterogenous impact.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;" lang="EN-GB">I have
taught undergraduate, master&#8217;s, and Ph.D. students at UEA and other
institutions. The bulk of my teaching has been to economics majors to
whom I have
taught microeconomics, econometrics, statistics, math methods,
industrial
organization, and health economics at both the graduate and
undergraduate levels.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I also have
significant experience at
teaching to non-economists.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this
regard, I have taught Health Economics and Policy to medical and public
health
students and Competition Economics and/IO to professionals from
regulatory
agencies and consulting firms.&nbsp; Currently, I both teach in and
serve as
the program co-director for the <a target="_blank" href="https://competitionpolicy.ac.uk/online-ccp-certificate">Postgraduate
Certificate in Competition and
Regulatory Policy</a> run via CCP at UEA. </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span lang="EN-GB"></span>I got my Ph.D. in Public Policy and
Management from the
Heinz School at Carnegie Mellon University, USA. Before joining UEA, I
was a Lecturer
(Assistant prof) at King&#8217;s College London (Department of Primary Care
and
Public Health Sciences) and before that an Assistant Professor at
Florida State
University (Department of Economics). I also did a two-year
post-doctoral stint
at the University of California, Berkeley (School of Public Health).<span style="">&nbsp; I got my undergraduate degree from Bard College, NY in physics and economics with a concentration in mathematics. <br>
<br>
I am of Pakistani origin (Lahori), have two children and a wife, and five siblings.&nbsp; <br>
