<h2>General Background</h2>

I am a lecture in the Department of Primary Care and Public Health Sciences. Prior to joining Kings, I was an assistant professor of economics at Florida State University. I received my high school certificate (HSC) from Aitchison College Lahore, Pakistan in 1988 and then came to the U.S. for undergraduate work in the fall of '89. I received a B.A. degree from Bard College in 1993 and got my Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon in 2001 and did my postdoctoral work (2000-2003) at the University of California, Berkeley.

My background is in health policy and health economics (applied micro and IO) with research interests in issues relating to competition, antitrust and technologies in hospital and pharmaceutical industries.  I also have interests in outcomes research, and research methods.  To date, my research has been in the areas of evolution of industrial structures, innovation, adoption and diffusion of health care technologies, managed care, and more recently in mental health issues. Specifically, I have an active research agenda in the the economic and policy analysis of Attention Deficit/Hyper Activity Disorder (ADHD) and market for psychostimulant drugs.
