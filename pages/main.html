<h2 style="font-weight: bold;">General Background</h2>

<p class="MsoNormal">I am an Associate Professor in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.uea.ac.uk/about/school-of-economics">School of Economics</a> and
the <a href="https://competitionpolicy.ac.uk/">Centre for Competition Policy (CCP)</a> at the University of East Anglia (UEA).<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am an empirical economist and most of my research uses applied microeconimic theory and idustrial organization (IO) and applies it to health care.&nbsp; I have a strong policy
focus. <o:p></o:p></p>



<p class="MsoNormal">I am also a co-editor at <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14657295" target="_blank">Economic Inquiry</a>. <o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My main <span lang="EN-GB">research
interests include competition policy and antitrust with a special interest in
health care, the hospital sector, and pharmaceuticals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have worked on the valuation of new pharmaceutical
products used in the treatment of ADHD, including generics and
second-generation drugs (`me-too' drugs) as well as firm strategies for growth
and entry deterrence (presentation proliferation, pay-for-delay, product
hopping). Currently, I am also working on regulations surrounding the
consumption of alcohol and the use of antibiotic drugs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I also work in the area of outcomes research and research
methods in health care.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I got my Ph.D. in Public Policy and Management from the
Heinz School at Carnegie Mellon University, USA. Before joining UEA, I was a Lecturer
(Assistant prof) at King&#8217;s College London (Department of Primary Care and
Public Health Sciences) and before that an Assistant Professor at Florida State
University (Department of Economics). I also did a two-year post-doctoral stint
at the University of California, Berkeley (School of Public Health).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>
