<h2 style="font-weight: bold;">General Background</h2>

<p class="MsoNormal">I am an Associate Professor in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.uea.ac.uk/about/school-of-economics">School of Economics</a> and
the <a href="https://competitionpolicy.ac.uk/">Centre for Competition Policy (CCP)</a> at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_East_Anglia">University of East Anglia (UEA)</a>.<span>&nbsp;
I am an empirical economist with a strong policy focus.&nbsp; My
research falls in two overlapping areas: (i) industrial organization
and competition economics and mostly applied to the health sector
(hospitals, pharmaceuticals, etc.) but not exclusively, and (ii) health
outcomes and health policies.&nbsp; The latter also spills over into
issues of education, gender, and racial equity.&nbsp; </span> <o:p></o:p></p>



<p class="MsoNormal">I am also a co-editor at <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14657295" target="_blank">Economic Inquiry</a>. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="" lang="EN-GB">Some of my
recent work in pharmaceuticals focuses on firm strategies and how they impact
consumer welfare, firm profits, and growth. I have worked on the valuation/welfare
effects of introducing generics and second-generation (`me-too') drugs in a
product market, the impact of additional presentations on the growth of a business
unit, and now more recently on entry deterring effects of presentation proliferation
and of product hopping.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have also
worked on pay-for-delay deals in the European and American legal contexts. One
of the main contributions of this work is the policy simulations that show which
legislative changes are likely to make anti-competitive deals not possible and
which might make the situation worse.<span style=""></span></span><span style="" lang="EN-GB"><o:p></o:p><br>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="" lang="EN-GB">Concurrently,
I am also working on policies to address the rise of antibacterial resistance via
managing the demand for broad- vs narrow-spectrum antibiotics as well as on evaluating
regulations to curb excessive alcohol consumption and its heterogenous impact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>







<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="" lang="EN-GB">I have
taught undergraduate, master&#8217;s, and Ph.D. students at UEA and other institutions
before, as well as supervised dissertations at all three levels. The bulk of my
teaching has been to economics students to whom I have typically taught
microeconomics, econometrics, statistics, math methods, industrial
organization, and health economics and policy. I also have significant
experience in teaching to non-economics majors. I have taught Health Economics and
Policy to medical and public health students as well as Competition Economics
and/IO to professionals from regulatory agencies and consulting firms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Currently, I both teach in and serve as the
program co-director for the Postgraduate Certificate in Competition and
Regulatory Policy at UEA. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
I got my Ph.D. in Public Policy and Management from the
Heinz School at Carnegie Mellon University, USA. Before joining UEA, I was a Lecturer
(Assistant prof) at King&#8217;s College London (Department of Primary Care and
Public Health Sciences) and before that an Assistant Professor at Florida State
University (Department of Economics). I also did a two-year post-doctoral stint
at the University of California, Berkeley (School of Public Health).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p>
